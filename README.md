## Requirements

Ensure the following libraries/programs are installed before using this tool:

* Python 3.11 or later
* `git` for cloning the repository
* `pipx` (install via `pip install pipx`)
* The latest version of FFmpeg, available in your system's PATH
* MKVToolNix (non-containerized versions only, such as Flatpak or Snap are not
  supported), with `mkvpropedit` accessible from the bundle

Additionally, you must obtain your own `cookie.txt` from BiliIntl, and ensure
that Premium is activated.

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
>
> Currently, we only support installation via `pipx` for better package
> management. If `pipx` is not installed, you can install it using
> `pip install pipx` or check if your distribution's package manager provides it.

> [!WARNING]
>
> If you're utilizing `pipxu` to manage bilidownloader, keep in mind that due
> to `uv`'s nature, it can not update the app from bare repository without
> reinstalling it first.

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/nattadasu/bilidownloader.git
```

```bash
# To enable ASS subtitle support, use the following command instead:
# Note: Depending on your device, installation may take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour.
pipx install 'bilidownloader[ass] @ git+https://github.com/nattadasu/bilidownloader.git'
```

```bash
# For Termux users, additional steps may be required:
pkg install x11-repo
pkg install busybox ffmpeg git mkvtoolnix openssl python python-pip
pip install pipx
pip install --extra-index-url "https://termux-user-repository.github.io/pypi/" pydantic
pipx install --system-site-packages git+https://github.com/nattadasu/bilidownloader.git
```

Starting from version `2.1.0`, dependencies for ASS subtitle support have been
made optional to ensure compatibility with headless devices and non-x86
architectures. This change eliminates the need for compiling dependencies but
sacrifices ASS track support.

For Termux users, it is not recommended to install the `ass` extra unless you
are confident in managing the additional unwritten requirements and
troubleshootings.

## Features

* Download episodes
* Retrieve the latest schedule
* Monitor and *automatically* download episodes for tracked series (watchlist)
* Manage your Favorite List directly from the terminal

## Limitations

* Cannot bypass premium restrictions: a premium account is required to download
  paywalled content
* Does not run in the background: use `crontab` or a task scheduler to automate
  periodic execution
* Cannot download user-uploaded content: the tool is specifically designed for
  episode URLs
* Does not support the Mainland version: it is tested only with the
  International version
* Does not automatically organize episodes into folders: use tools like FileBot
  for this purpose

## Usage

Run `bilidownloader` from your terminal. The program uses Typer to build its
CLI, so all commands and options are automatically well-documented. Use the
`--help` parameter for more details.

### Global Options

* `--help`: Show help for commands and subcommands.

## Commands

## Configuration

The tool uses three main files to store your data: `cookie.txt`, `watchlist.txt`,
and `history.v2.tsv`. By default, these files are located in the appropriate
user data directory for your operating system. You can override the location
of these files using the `--cookie`, `--watchlist`, and `--history` options.

### Cookie File

You must provide a `cookie.txt` file from BiliBili to download premium content.
You can specify the path to your cookie file using the `--cookie` option.

### Watchlist File

Your watchlist is stored in `watchlist.txt`. This file contains the series IDs
and titles of the shows you are monitoring.

### History File

Your download history is stored in `history.v2.tsv`. This file logs every episode
you download, preventing duplicate downloads.

## Development and Testing

To test the application, use the following command:

```bash
pipx install --suffix "_test" ".[ass]"
```

This installs the package with the `ass` extra in a separate environment,
allowing you to test without affecting your main installation.
