## Requirements

This tool requires following libraries/programs to be installed first:

* Python => 3.11
* Latest FFmpeg, and available on PATH
* MKVToolNix, not containerized (Flatpak, Snap, etc) and available on PATH. `mkvpropedit` must be available from the bundle.
* `pipx` (install with `pip install pipx`)

Additionally, you also required to obtain your own cookie.txt from BiliIntl and
Premium is activated as well.

## Installation

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/nattadasu/bilidownloader.git
```

## Usage

Simply call `bilidownloader` from your terminal! The program used Typer to build
CLI, so anything is properly documented by simply dding `--help` param.

### What it can do

* Download episode
* Get latest schedule
* Monitor and *automatically* download episode for tracked series (watchlist)
* Manage Favorite List directly from the terminal

### What it CAN'T do

* Bypassing premium: you'd still requires one to download paywalled contents
* Background check: use `crontab` or any task scheduler to run the program
  periodically
* Downloads user-uploaded content. The program was specifically tailored for
  episode URLs instead
* Ripping Mainland version. This program only tested to be used for International
  version
* Automatically manage the episode to dedicated folders: use FileBot or any
  similar tools to do so.
