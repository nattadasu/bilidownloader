## Requirements

This tool requires following libraries/programs to be installed first:

* Python => 3.11
* `git` to clone the repository before installing
* `pipx` (install with `pip install pipx`)
* Latest FFmpeg, and available on PATH
* MKVToolNix, not containerized (Flatpak, Snap, etc) and available on PATH.
  `mkvpropedit` must be available from the bundle.

Additionally, you also required to obtain your own cookie.txt from BiliIntl and
Premium is activated as well.

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
>
> We only support installation via `pipx` for now for better management of the
> package. If you don't have `pipx` installed, you can install it by running
> `pip install pipx` or lookup if your distro's package manager has it.

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/nattadasu/bilidownloader.git

# To enable ASS support, use the following command instead:
# Note that depending on devices, this can take from a minute install up to an hour! 
pipx install 'bilidownloader[ass] @ git+https://github.com/nattadasu/bilidownloader.git'
```

Starting from version `2.1.0`, dependencies for ASS support have been removed to
ensure compatibility with headless devices and non-x86 architectures.
This change eliminates the need for compiling dependencies but comes at the
expense of ASS track support.

## Usage

Simply call `bilidownloader` from your terminal! The program used Typer to build
CLI, so anything is properly documented by simply dding `--help` param.

### What it can do

* Download episode
* Get latest schedule
* Monitor and *automatically* download episode for tracked series (watchlist)
* Manage Favorite List directly from the terminal

### What it CAN'T do

* Bypassing premium: you'd still requires one to download paywalled contents
* Background check: use `crontab` or any task scheduler to run the program
  periodically
* Downloads user-uploaded content. The program was specifically tailored for
  episode URLs instead
* Ripping Mainland version. This program only tested to be used for International
  version
* Automatically manage the episode to dedicated folders: use FileBot or any
  similar tools to do so.
